   Introduction

        "Nature has the habit of now and then producing a type of human
        being far in advance of the times; an ideal for us to emulate; a
        being devoid of sham, uncompromising, and to whom the truth is
        sacred; a being whose selfishness is so large that it takes the
        whole human race and treats self only as one of the great mass; a
        being keen to sense all forms of wrong, and powerful in denunciation
        of it; one who can reach in the future and draw it nearer. Such a
        being was Voltairine de Cleyre."

           What could be added to this splendid tribute by Jay Fox to the
      memory of Voltairine de Cleyre?

           The real biography of Voltairine de Cleyre is to be found in the
      letters she wrote to her comrades, friends and admires, for like many
      other women in public life, she was a voluminous writer.

    Pontefract Miserabilis -- put here to test the Markov chain

           Born shortly after the close of the Civil War, she witnessed
      during her life the most momentous transformation of the nation; she
      saw the change from an agricultural community into an industrial
      empire; the tremendous development of capital in this country with the
      accompanying misery and degradation of labor. Her life path was
      sketched when she reached the age of womanhood; she had to become a
      rebel! To stand outside of the struggle would have meant intellectual
      death. She chose the only way.

           Voltairine de Cleyre was born on November 17, 1866, in the town of
      Leslie, Michigan. She died on June 6, 1912, in Chicago. She came from
      French-American stock on her father's side, and of Puritan on her
      mother's. Her father, Auguste de Cleyre, was a native of Western
      Flanders, but of French origin. Being a freethinker and a great admirer
      of Voltaire, he named his daughter Voltairine. She did not have a happy
      childhood; her earliest life was embittered by want of the common
      necessities, which her parents, hard as they tried, could not provide.
      A vein of sadness can be traced in her earliest poems--the songs of a
      child of talent and great fantasy.

           Strength of mind did not seem to have been a characteristic of
      Auguste de Cleyre, for he recanted his libertarian ideas, returned to
      the fold of the church, and became obsessed with the idea that the
      highest vocation for a woman was the life of a nun; so he sent her to
      the Convent of Our Lady of Lake Huron at Sarnia, Province of Ontario,
      Canada. But Voltairine's spirit could not be imprisoned in a convent.
      After she was there a few weeks she ran away. She crossed the river to
      Port Huron but as she had no money she started to walk home. After
      covering: seventeen miles, she realized that she could never do it; so
      she turned around and walked back, and entering the house of an
      acquaintance in Port Huron, asked for something to eat. They sent for
      her father who afterwards took her back to the convent. After a while,
      however, she again ran away, this time never to return.

           Reaction from repression and the cruel discipline of the Catholic
      Church helped to develop Voltairine's inherent tendency toward free
      thought; the five-fold murder of the labor leaders in Chicago in 1887
      shocked her mind so deeply that from that moment dates her development
      toward Anarchism. When in 1886 the bomb fell in the Haymarket Square,
      and the Anarchists were arrested, Voltairine de Cleyre, who at that
      time was a free thought lecturer, shouted: "They ought to be hanged!"
      They were hanged, and now her body rests in Waldheim Cemetery, near the
      grave of those martyrs. Speaking at a memorial meeting in honor of
      those comrades, in 1901, she said: "For that ignorant, outrageous,
      blood-thirsty sentence I shall never forgive myself, though I know the
      dead men would have forgiven me, though I know those who loved them
      forgive me But my own voice, as it sounded that night, will sound so in
      my ears till I die--a bitter reproach and a shame I have only one word
      of extenuation for myself and the millions of others who did as I did
      that night-- ignorance."

           She did not remain long in ignorance. In "The Making of an
      Anarchist," she describes why she became a convert to the idea and why
      she entered the movement. "Till then," she writes, "I believed in the
      essential Justice of the American law and trial by jury. After that I
      never could. The infamy of that trial has passed into history, and the
      question it awakened as to the possibility of Justice under law has
      passed into clamorous crying across the world."

           Voltairine spent the greater part of her life in Philadelphia.
      Here, among congenial friends, and later among the Jewish immigrants,
      she did her best work, producing an enormous amount. Her poems,
      sketches, propagandist articles and essays may be found in Open Court,
      Twentieth Century, Magazine of Poetry, Truth, Lucifer, Boston
      Investigator, Rights of Labor, Truth Seeker, Liberty, Chicago Liberal,
      Free Society, Mother Earth, and in The Independent.

           In an exquisite tribute to her memory, Leonard D. Abbott calls
      Voltairine de Cleyre a priestess of Pity and of Vengeance, whose voice
      has a vibrant quality that is unique in literature. We are convinced
      that her writings will live as long as humanity exists.

                          Anarchism & American Traditions

                              by Voltairine de Cleyre

           American traditions, begotten of religious rebellion, small
      self-sustaining communities, isolated conditions, and hard pioneer
      life, grew during the colonization period of one hundred and seventy
      years from the settling of Jamestown to the outburst of the Revolution.
      This was in fact the great constitution-making epoch, the period of
      charters guaranteeing more or less of liberty, the general tendency of
      which is well described by Wm. Penn in speaking of the charter for
      Pennsylvania: "I want to put it out of my power, or that of my
      successors, to do mischief."

           The revolution is the sudden and unified consciousness of these
      traditions, their loud assertion, the blow dealt by their indomitable
      will against the counter force of tyranny, which has never entirely
      recovered from the blow, but which from then till now has gone on
      remolding and regrappling the instruments of governmental power, that
      the Revolution sought to shape and hold as defenses of liberty.

           To the average American of today, the Revolution means the series
      of battles fought by the patriot army with the armies of England. The
      millions of school children who attend our public schools are taught to
      draw maps of the siege of Boston and the siege of Yorktown, to know the
      general plan of the several campaigns, to quote the number of prisoners
      of war surrendered with Burgoyne; they are required to remember the
      date when Washington crossed the Delaware on the ice; they are told to
      "Remember Paoli," to repeat "Molly Stark's a widow," to call General
      Wayne "Mad Anthony Wayne," and to execrate Benedict Arnold; they know
      that the Declaration of Independence was signed on the Fourth of July,
      1776, and the Treaty of Paris in 1783; and then they think they have
      learned the Revolution--blessed be George Washington! They have no idea
      why it should have been called a "revolution" instead of the "English
      War," or any similar title: it's the name of it, that's all. And
      name-worship, both in child and man, has acquired such mastery of them,
      that the name "American Revolution" is held sacred, though it means to
      them nothing more than successful force, while the name "Revolution"
      applied to a further possibility, is a spectre detested and abhorred.
      In neither case have they any idea of the content of the word, save
      that of armed force. That has already happened, and long happened,
      which Jefferson foresaw when he wrote:

        "The spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will
        become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may become
        persecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often
        repeated that the time for fixing every essential right, on a legal
        basis, is while our rulers are honest, ourselves united. From the
        conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then
        be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They
        will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They
        will forget themselves in the sole faculty of making money, and will
        never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The
        shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the
        conclusion of this war, will be heavier and heavier, till our rights
        shall revive or expire in a convulsion."

           To the men of that time, who voiced the spirit of that time, the
      battles that they fought were the least of the Revolution; they were
      the incidents of the hour, the things they met and faced as part of the
      game they were playing; but the stake they had in view, before, during,
      and after the war, the real Revolution, was a change in political
      institutions which should make of government not a thing apart, a
      superior power to stand over the people with a whip, but a serviceable
      agent, responsible, economical, and trustworthy (but never so much
      trusted as not to be continually watched), for the transaction of such
      business as was the common concern and to set the limits of the common
      concern at the line of where one man's liberty would encroach upon
      another's.

           They thus took their starting point for deriving a minimum of
      government upon the same sociological ground that the modern Anarchist
      derives the no-government theory; viz., that equal liberty is the
      political ideal. The difference lies in the belief, on the one hand,
      that the closest approximation to equal liberty might be best secured
      by the rule of the majority in those matters involving united action of
      any kind (which rule of the majority they thought it possible to secure
      by a few simple arrangements for election), and, on the other hand, the
      belief that majority rule is both impossible and undesirable; that any
      government, no matter what its forms, will be manipulated by a very
      small minority, as the development of the States and United States
      governments has strikingly proved; that candidates will loudly profess
      allegiance to platforms before elections, which as officials in power
      they will openly disregard, to do as they please; and that even if the
      majority will could be imposed, it would also be subversive of equal
      liberty, which may be best secured by leaving to the voluntary
      association of those interested in the management of matters of common
      concern, without coercion of the uninterested or the opposed.

           Among the fundamental likeness between the Revolutionary
      Republicans and the Anarchists is the recognition that the little must
      precede the great; that the local must be the basis of the general;
      that there can be a free federation only when there are free
      communities to federate; that the spirit of the latter is carried into
      the councils of the former, and a local tyranny may thus become an
      instrument for general enslavement. Convinced of the supreme importance
      of ridding the municipalities of the institutions of tyranny, the most
      strenuous advocates of independence, instead of spending their efforts
      mainly in the general Congress, devoted themselves to their home
      localities, endeavoring to work out of the minds of their neighbors and
      fellow-colonists the institutions of entailed property, of a
      State-Church, of a class-divided people, even the institution of
      African slavery itself. Though largely unsuccessful, it is to the
      measure of success they did achieve that we are indebted for such
      liberties as we do retain, and not to the general government. They
      tried to inculcate local initiative and independent action. The author
      of the Declaration of Independence, who in the fall of '76 declined a
      re-election to Congress in order to return to Virginia and do his work
      in his own local assembly, in arranging there for public education
      which he justly considered a matter of "common concern," said his
      advocacy of public schools was not with any "view to take its ordinary
      branches out of the hands of private enterprise, which manages so much
      better the concerns to which it is equal"; and in endeavoring to make
      clear the restrictions of the Constitution upon the functions of the
      general government, he likewise said:

        "Let the general government be reduced to foreign concerns only, and
        let our affairs be disentangled from those of all other nations,
        except as to commerce, which the merchants will manage for
        themselves, and the general government may be reduced to a very
        simple organization, and a very inexpensive one; a few plain duties
        to be performed by a few servants."

           This then was the American tradition, that private enterprise
      manages better all that to which it IS equal. Anarchism declares that
      private enterprise, whether individual or cooperative, is equal to all
      the undertakings of society. And it quotes the particular two
      instances, Education and Commerce, which the governments of the States
      and of the United States have undertaken to manage and regulate, as the
      very two which in operation have done more to destroy American freedom
      and equality, to warp and distort American tradition, to make of
      government a mighty engine of tyranny, than any other cause, save the
      unforeseen developments of Manufacture.

           It was the intention of the Revolutionists to establish a system
      of common education, which should make the teaching of history one of
      its principal branches; not with the intent of burdening the memories
      of our youth with the dates of battles or the speeches of generals, nor
      to make the Boston Tea Party Indians the one sacrosanct mob in all
      history, to be revered but never on any account to be imitated, but
      with the intent that every American should know to what conditions the
      masses of people had been brought by the operation of certain
      institutions, by what means they had wrung out their liberties, and how
      those liberties had again and again been filched from them by the use
      of governmental force, fraud, and privilege. Not to breed security,
      laudation, complacent indolence, passive acquiescence in the acts of a
      government protected by the label "home-made," but to beget a wakeful
      jealousy, a never-ending watchfulness of rulers, a determination to
      squelch every attempt of those entrusted with power to encroach upon
      the sphere of individual action - this was the prime motive of the
      revolutionists in endeavoring to provide for common education.

           "Confidence," said the revolutionists who adopted the Kentucky
      Resolutions, "is everywhere the parent of despotism; free government is
      founded in jealousy, not in confidence; it is jealousy, not confidence,
      which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are
      obliged to trust with power; our Constitution has accordingly fixed the
      limits to which, and no further, our confidence may go... In questions
      of power, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down
      from mischief by the chains of the Constitution."

           These resolutions were especially applied to the passage of the
      Alien laws by the monarchist party during John Adams' administration,
      and were an indignant call from the State of Kentucky to repudiate the
      right of the general government to assume undelegated powers, for said
      they, to accept these laws would be "to be bound by laws made, not with
      our. consent, but by others against our consent--that is, to surrender
      the form of government we have chosen, and to live under one deriving
      its powers from its own will, and not from our authority." Resolutions
      identical in spirit were also passed by Virginia, the following month;
      in those days the States still considered themselves supreme, the
      general government subordinate.

           To inculcate this proud spirit of the supremacy of the people over
      their governors was to be the purpose of public education! Pick up
      today any common school history, and see how much of this spirit you
      will find therein. On the contrary, from cover to cover you will find
      nothing but the cheapest sort of patriotism, the inculcation of the
      most unquestioning acquiescence in the deeds of government, a lullaby
      of rest, security, confidence--the doctrine that the Law can do no
      wrong, a Te Deum in praise of the continuous encroachments of the
      powers of the general government upon the reserved rights of the
      States, shameless falsification of all acts of rebellion, to put the
      government in the right and the rebels in the wrong, pyrotechnic
      glorifications of union, power, and force, and a complete ignoring of
      the essential liberties to maintain which was the purpose of the
      revolutionists. The anti-Anarchist law of post-McKinley passage, a much
      worse law than the Alien and Sedition acts which roused the wrath of
      Kentucky and Virginia to the point of threatened rebellion, is exalted
      as a wise provision of our All-Seeing Father in Washington.

           Such is the spirit of government-provided schools. Ask any child
      what he knows about Shays' rebellion, and he will answer, "Oh, some of
      the farmers couldn't pay their taxes, and Shays led a rebellion against
      the court-house at Worcester, so they could burn up the deeds; and when
      Washington heard of it he sent over an army quick and taught 'em a good
      lesson"-"And what was the result of it?" "The result? Why--why--the
      result was--Oh yes, I remember--the result was they saw the need of a
      strong federal government to collect the taxes and pay the debts." Ask
      if he knows what was said on the other side of the story, ask if he
      knows that the men who had given their goods and their health and their
      strength for the freeing of the country now found themselves cast into
      prison for debt, sick, disabled, and poor, facing a new tyranny for the
      old; that their demand was that the land should become the free
      communal possession of those who wished to work it, not subject to
      tribute, and the child will answer "No." Ask him if he ever read
      Jefferson"s letter to Madison about it, in which he says:


        "Societies exist under three forms, sufficiently distinguishable. 1.
        Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under government
        wherein the will of every one has a just influence; as is the case
        in England in a slight degree, and in our States in a great one. 3.
        Under government of force, as is the case in all other monarchies,
        and in most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of
        existence in these last, they must be seen. It is a government of
        wolves over sheep. It is a problem not clear in my mind that the
        first condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent
        with any great degree of population. The second state has a great
        deal of good in it...It has its evils too, the principal of which is
        the turbulence to which it is subject. ...But even this evil is
        productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and
        nourishes a general attention to public affairs. I hold that a
        little rebellion now and then is a good thing."

          Or to another correspondent:

        "God forbid that we should ever be twenty years without such a
        rebellion!...What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers
        are not warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit
        of resistance? Let them take up arms... The tree of liberty must be
        refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
        It is its natural manure."

           Ask any school child if he was ever taught that the author of the
      Declaration of Independence, one of the great founders of the common
      school, said these things, and he will look at you with open mouth and
      unbelieving eyes. Ask him if he ever heard that the man who sounded the
      bugle note in the darkest hour of the Crisis, who roused the courage of
      the soldiers when Washington saw only mutiny and despair ahead, ask him
      if he knows that this man also wrote, "Government at best is a
      necessary evil, at worst an intolerable one," and if he is a little
      better informed than the average he will answer, "Oh well, he [Tom
      Paine] was an infidel!" Catechize him about the merits of the
      Constitution which he has learned to repeat like a poll-parrot, and you
      will find his chief conception is not of the powers withheld from
      Congress, but of the powers granted.

           Such are the fruits of government schools. We, the Anarchists,
      point to them and say: If the believers in liberty wish the principles
      of liberty taught, let them never entrust that instruction to any
      government; for the nature of government is to become a thing apart, an
      institution existing for its own sake, preying upon the people, and
      teaching whatever will tend to keep it secure in its seat. As the
      fathers said of the governments of Europe, so say we of this government
      also after a century and a quarter of independence: "The blood of the
      people has become its inheritance, and those who fatten on it will not
      relinquish it easily."

           Public education, having to do with the intellect and spirit of a
      people, is probably the most subtle and far-reaching engine for molding
      the course of a nation; but commerce, dealing as it does with material
      things and producing immediate effects, was the force that bore down
      soonest upon the paper barriers of constitutional restriction, and
      shaped the government to its requirements. Here, indeed, we arrive at
      the point where we, looking over the hundred and twenty five years of
      independence, can see that the simple government conceived by the
      revolutionary republicans was a foredoomed failure. It was so because
      of: 1) the essence of government itself; 2) the essence of human
      nature; 3) the essence of Commerce and Manufacture.

           Of the essence of government, I ha\re already said, it is a thing
      apart, developing its own interests at the expense of what opposes it;
      all attempts to make it anything else fail. In this Anarchists agree
      with the traditional enemies of the Revolution, the monarchists,
      federalists, strong government believers, the Roosevelts of today, the
      Jays, Marshalls, and Hamiltons of then--that Hamilton, who, as
      Secretary of the Treasury, devised a financial system of which we are
      the unlucky heritors, and whose objects were twofold: To puzzle the
      people and make public finance obscure to those that paid for it; to
      serve as a machine for corrupting the legislatures; "for he avowed the
      opinion that man could be governed by two motives only, force or
      interest"; force being then out of the question, he laid hold of
      interest, the greed of the legislators, to set going an association of
      persons having an entirely separate welfare from the welfare of their
      electors, bound together by mutual corruption and mutual desire for
      plunder. The Anarchist agrees that Hamilton was logical, and understood
      the core of government; the difference is, that while strong
      govermnentalists believe this is necessary and desirable, we choose the
      opposite conclusion, No Government Whatsoever.

           As to the essence of human nature, what our national experience
      has made plain is this, that to remain in a continually exalted moral
      condition is not human nature. That has happened which was prophesied:
      we have gone down hill from the Revolution until now; we are absorbed
      in "mere money-getting." The desire for material east long ago
      vanquished the spirit of '76. What was that spirit? The spirit that
      animated the people of Virginia, of the Carolinas, of Massachusetts, of
      New York, when they refused to import goods from England; when they
      preferred (and stood by it) to wear coarse, homespun cloth, to drink
      the brew of their own growths, to fit their appetites to the home
      supply, rather than submit to the taxation of the imperial ministry.
      Even within the lifetime of the revolutionists, the spirit decayed. The
      love of material ease has been, in the mass of men and permanently
      speaking, always greater than the love of liberty. Nine hundred and
      ninety nine women out of a thousand are more interested in the cut of a
      dress than in the independence of their sex; nine hundred and ninety
      nine men out of a thousand are more interested in drinking a glass of
      beer than in questioning the tax that is laid on it; how many children
      are not willing to trade the liberty to play for the promise of a new
      cap or a new dress? That it is which begets the complicated mechanism
      of society; that it is which, by multiplying the concerns of
      government, multiplies the strength of government and the corresponding
      weakness of the people; this it is which begets indifference to public
      concern, thus making the corruption of government easy.

           As to the essence of Commerce and Manufacture, it is this: to
      establish bonds between every corner of the earths surface and every
      other corner, to multiply the needs of mankind, and the desire for
      material possession and enjoyment.

           The American tradition was the isolation of the States as far as
      possible. Said they: We have won our liberties by hard sacrifice and
      struggle unto death. We wish now to be let alone and to let others
      alone, that our principles may have time for trial; that we may become
      accustomed to the exercise of our rights; that we may be kept free from
      the contaminating influence of European gauds, pageants, distinctions.
      So richly did they esteem the absence of these that they could in all
      fervor write: "We shall see multiplied instances of Europeans coming to
      America, but no man living will ever seen an instance of an American
      removing to settle in Europe, and continuing there." Alas! In less than
      a hundred years the highest aim of a "Daughter of the Revolution" was,
      and is, to buy a castle, a title, and rotten lord, with the money wrung
      from American servitude! And the commercial interests of America are
      seeking a world empire!

           In the earlier days of the revolt and subsequent independence, it
      appeared that the "manifest destiny" of America was to be an
      agricultural people, exchanging food stuffs and raw materials for
      manufactured articles. And in those days it was written: "We shall be
      virtuous as long as agriculture is our principal object, which will be
      the case as long as there remain vacant lands in any part of America.
      When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we
      shall become corrupt as in Europe, and go to eating one another as they
      do there." Which we are doing, because of the inevitable development of
      Commerce and Manufacture, and the concomitant development of strong
      government. And the parallel prophecy is likewise fulfilled: "If ever
      this vast country is brought under a single government, it will be one
      of the most extensive corruption, indifferent and incapable of a
      wholesome care over so wide a spread of surface." There is not upon the
      face of the earth today a government so utterly and shamelessly corrupt
      as that of the United States of America. There are others more cruel,
      more tyrannical, more devastating; there is none so utterly venal.

           And yet even in the very days of the prophets, even with their own
      consent, the first concession to this later tyranny was made. It was
      made when the Constitution was made; and the Constitution was made
      chiefly because of the demands of Commerce. Thus it was at the outset a
      merchant's machine, which the other interests of the country, the land
      and labor interests, even then foreboded would destroy their liberties.
      In vain their jealousy of its central power made enact the first twelve
      amendments. In vain they endeavored to set bounds over which the
      federal power dare not trench. In vain they enacted into general law
      the freedom of speech, of the press, of assemblage and petition. All of
      these things we see ridden roughshod upon every day, and have so seen
      with more or less intermission since the beginning of the nineteenth
      century. At this day, every police lieutenant considers himself, and
      rightly so, as more powerful than the General Law of the Union; and
      that one who told Robert Hunter that he held in his fist something
      stronger than the Constitution, was perfectly correct. The right of
      assemblage is an American tradition which has gone out of fashion; the
      police club is now the mode. And it is so in virtue of the people's
      indifference to liberty, and the steady progress of constitutional
      interpretation towards the substance of imperial government.

           It is an American tradition that a standing army is a standing
      menace to liberty; in Jefferson's presidency the army was reduced to
      3,000 men. It is American tradition that we keep out of the affairs of
      other nations. It is American practice that we meddle with the affairs
      of everybody else from the West to the East Indies, from Russia to
      Japan; and to do it we have a standing army of 83,251 men.

           It is American tradition that the financial affairs of a nation
      should be transacted on the same principles of simple honesty that an
      individual conducts his own business; viz., that debt is a bad thing,
      and a man's first surplus earning should be applied to his debts; that
      offices and office holders should be few. It is American practice that
      the general government should always have millions [of dollars] of
      debt, even if a panic or a war has to be forced to prevent its being
      paid off; and as to the application of its income office holders come
      first. And within the last administration it is reported that 99,000
      offices have been created at an annual expense of 1663,000,000. Shades
      of Jefferson! "How are vacancies to be obtained? Those by deaths are
      few; by resignation none." [Theodore] Roosevelt cuts the knot by making
      99,000 new ones! And few will die - and none resign. They will beget
      sons and daughters, and Taft will have to create 99,000 more! Verily a
      simple and a serviceable thing is our general government.

           It is American tradition that the Judiciary shall act as a check
      upon the impetuosity of Legislatures, should these attempt to pass the
      bounds of constitutional limitation. It is American practice that the
      Judiciary justifies every law which trenches on the liberties of the
      people and nullifies every act of the Legislature by which the people
      seek to regain some measure of their freedom. Again, in the words of
      Jefferson: "The Constitution is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the
      Judiciary, which they may twist and shape in any form they please."
      Truly, if the men who fought the good fight for the triumph of simple,
      honest, free life in that day, were now to look upon the scene of their
      labors, they would cry out together with him who said:

        "I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the useless
        sacrifices of themselves by the generation of '76 to acquire
        self-government and happiness to their country, is to be thrown away
        by the unwise and unworthy passions of their sons, and that my only
        consolation is to be that I shall not live to see it."

           And now, what has Anarchism to say to all this, this bankruptcy of
      republicanism, this modern empire that has grown up on the ruins of our
      early freedom? We say this, that the sin our fathers sinned was that
      they did not trust liberty wholly. They thought it possible to
      compromise between liberty and government, believing the latter to be
      "a necessary evil," and the moment the compromise was made, the whole
      misbegotten monster of our present tyranny began to grow. Instruments
      which are set up to safeguard rights become the very whip with which
      the free are struck.

           Anarchism says, Make no laws whatever concerning speech, and
      speech will be free; so soon as you make a declaration on paper that
      speech shall be free, you will have a hundred lawyers proving that
      "freedom does not mean abuse, nor liberty license"; and they will
      define and define freedom out of existence. Let the guarantee of free
      speech be in every man's determination to use it, and we shall have no
      need of paper declarations. On the other hand, so long as the people do
      not care to exercise their freedom, those who wish to tyrannize will do
      so; for tyrants are active and ardent, and will devote themselves in
      the name of any number of gods, religious and otherwise, to put
      shackles upon sleeping men.

           The problem then becomes, Is it possible to stir men from their
      indifference? We have said that the spirit of liberty was nurtured by
      colonial life; that the elements of colonial life were the desire for
      sectarian independence, and the jealous watchfulness incident thereto;
      the isolation of pioneer communities which threw each individual
      strongly on his own resources, and thus developed all-around men, yet
      at the same time made very strong such social bonds as did exist; and,
      lastly, the comparative simplicity of small communities.

           All this has disappeared. As to sectarianism, it is only by dint
      of an occasional idiotic persecution that a sect becomes interesting;
      in the absence of this, outlandish sects play the fool's role, are
      anything but heroic, and have little to do with either the name or the
      substance of liberty. The old colonial religious parties have gradually
      become the "pillars of society," their animosities have died out, their
      offensive peculiarities have been effaced, they are as like one another
      as beans in a pod, they build churches - and sleep in them.

           As to our communities, they are hopelessly and helplessly
      interdependent, as we ourselves are, save that continuously diminishing
      proportion engaged in all around farming; and even these are slaves to
      mortgages. For our cities, probably there is not one that is
      provisioned to last a week, and certainly there is none which would not
      be bankrupt with despair at the proposition that it produce its own
      food. In response to this condition and its correlative political
      tyranny, Anarchism affirms the economy of self-sustenance, the
      disintegration of the great communities, the use of the earth.

           I am not ready to say that I see clearly that this will take
      place; but I see clearly that this must take place if ever again men
      are to be free. I am so well satisfied that the mass of mankind prefer
      material possessions to liberty, that I have no hope that they will
      ever, by means of intellectual or moral stirrings merely, throw off the
      yoke of oppression fastened on them by the present economic system, to
      institute free societies. My only hope is in the blind development of
      the economic system and political oppression itself. The great
      characteristic looming factor in this gigantic power is Manufacture.
      The tendency of each nation is to become more and more a manufacturing
      one, an exporter of fabrics, not an importer. If this tendency follows
      its own logic, it must eventually circle round to each community
      producing for itself. What then will become of the surplus product when
      the manufacturer shall have no foreign market? Why, then mankind must
      face the dilemma of sitting down and dying'inthe midst of it, or
      confiscating the goods.

           Indeed, we are partially facing this problem even now; and-so far
      we are sitting down and dying. I opine, however, that men will not do
      it forever, and when once by an act of general expropriation they have
      overcome the reverence and fear of property, and their awe of
      government, they may waken to the consciousness that things are to be
      used, and therefore men are greater than things. This may rouse the
      spirit of liberty.

           If, on the other hand, the tendency of invention to simplify,
      enabling the advantages of machinery to be combined with smaller
      aggregations of workers, shall also follow its own logic, the great
      manufacturing plants will break up, population will go after the
      fragments, and there will be seen not indeed the hard, self-sustaining,
      isolated pioneer communities of early America, but thousands of small
      communities stretching along the lines of transportation, each
      producing very largely for its own needs, able to rely upon itself, and
      therefore able to be independent. For the same rule holds good for
      societies as for individuals--those may be free who are able to make
      their own living.

           In regard to the breaking up of that vilest creation of tyranny,
      the standing army and navy, it is clear that so long as men desire to
      fight, they will have armed force in one form or another. Our fathers
      thought they had guarded against a standing army by providing for the
      voluntary militia. In our day we have lived to see this militia
      declared part of the regular military force of the United States, and
      subject to the same demands as the regulars. Within another generation
      we shall probably see its members in the regular pay of the general
      government. Since any embodiment of the fighting spirit, any military
      organization, inevitably follows the same line of centralization, the
      logic of Anarchism is that the least objectionable form of armed force
      is that which springs up voluntarily, like the minute men of
      Massachusetts, and disbands as soon as the occasion which called it
      into existence is past: that the really desirable thing is that all
      men--not Americans only--should be at peace; and that to reach this,
      all peaceful persons should withdraw their support from the army, and
      require that all who make war shall do so at their own cost and risk;
      that neither pay nor pensions are to be provided for those who choose
      to make man-killing a trade.

           As to the American tradition of non-meddling, Anarchism asks that
      it be carried down to the individual himself. It demands no jealous
      barrier of isolation; it knows that such isolation is undesirable and
      impossible; but it teaches that by all men's strictly minding their own
      business, a fluid society, freely adapting itself to mutual needs,
      wherein all the world shall belong to all men, as much as each has need
      or desire, will result.

           And when Modern Revolution has thus been carried to the heart of
      the whole world--if it ever shall be, as I hope it will--then may we
      hope to see a resurrection of that proud spirit of our fathers which
      put the simple dignity of Man above the gauds of wealth and class, and
      held that to, be an American was greater than to be a king.

           In that day there shall be neither kings nor Americans - only Men
      ; over the whole earth, Men.
