ConsensoBot
===========

ConsensoBot is an IRC bot that will live on #noisebridge and do various housekeeping items. 

Its goals are:

* To more strongly link the space to the IRC channel, and vice versa.
* To act as an ongoing outlet for Consenso, our rapidly accelerating AI
* To be funny, ahahhahahaa.
