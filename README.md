Consensobot
===========

Consensobot is an IRC bot that lives on #noisebridge and does various housekeeping items. 

Consensobot's goals are:

* To more strongly link the space to the IRC channel, and vice versa.
* To act as an ongoing outlet for Consenso, our rapidly accelerating AI


Stories
-------

As a CLI user, I want to be able to add a corpus item, so that Consenso can learn more about Anarchist texts.

As an IRC user, I want to be able to see Consenso on an IRC channel, so that I can send it commands and listen to output.

As an administrator, I want to be able to push Consenso to a remote machine, and have it install and run.
